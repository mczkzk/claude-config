## Development Workflow

For larger implementations, use this structured approach:

### 1. Investigation & Requirements | Normal Mode
- Run `/plan-search [feature-name]` to create investigation checklist
- System prompts for specifications, screenshots, requirements
- Complete all investigation items through interactive conversation
- Thorough codebase, database, and dependency analysis
- **Tip**: Save screenshots in `plans/` directory for easy reference during search phase

### 2. Plan Creation | Normal Mode  
- Run `/plan-build [feature-name]` (requires completed plan-search)
- Creates detailed plan document with automatic section completeness verification
- Document includes: API design, data structures, component architecture, test strategy

### 3. Implementation | Auto-accept Mode
- Use natural language: "go", "この計画を実装して", or specify plan document
- Auto-accept mode enables rapid, uninterrupted development cycles

### 4. Archive
- Move completed or shelved plan documents to `plans/archive/` directory
- Keeps active workspace clean while preserving work for reference

### Context Recovery
When context is lost during development:
- Reference the plan document
- Re-paste screenshots if needed
- Ensure all requirements are still captured

## Project Tips

### Incident Documentation
For individual projects, consider creating a `docs/incidents/` directory to document failures, major setbacks, and lessons learned. Add `@docs/incidents/` to your project's CLAUDE.md to help Claude Code learn from past mistakes and prevent similar issues.

## How to Sync Settings on Another PC

If you have an existing `~/.claude` directory, you can sync only the configuration files using the following steps:

```bash
# Navigate to .claude directory
cd ~/.claude

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/mczkzk/claude-config.git

# Fetch from remote
git fetch origin

# Create local branch tracking remote main branch
git checkout -b main origin/main

# Checkout individual files if needed
git checkout origin/main -- docs/
git checkout origin/main -- commands/
git checkout origin/main -- CLAUDE.md
git checkout origin/main -- settings.json
git checkout origin/main -- .gitignore
```

## Notes

The following directories contain PC-specific data and are excluded from synchronization:
- `ide/` - IDE-related temporary files
- `projects/` - Project history
- `statsig/` - Statistics data
- `todos/` - TODO history

These are excluded by `.gitignore`, so they won't be affected during synchronization.
