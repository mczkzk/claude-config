# Pre-Planning Investigation Command

Creates investigation checklist and gathers requirements before implementation planning.

## Usage

```
/pre-plan [feature-name]
# Creates investigation checklist and starts requirements gathering
```

## Command Flow

### 1. Create Investigation File
- Generate `todos/[feature-name]-pre-plan.md`
- Include comprehensive investigation checklist
- All items must be completed before `/plan` command

### 2. Requirements Gathering
Prompt user to provide:
- **Specifications**: Technical requirements, user stories
- **Screenshots**: UI mockups, design references
- **Context**: Background information, constraints
- **Examples**: Similar features, reference implementations

### 3. Interactive Investigation
Guide user through checklist completion:
- Codebase analysis
- Database investigation
- External dependencies validation
- Technical requirements clarification

## Investigation Checklist Template

```markdown
# Pre-Planning Investigation - [Feature Name]

## üìã Requirements Gathering
- [ ] **Specifications provided**: Technical requirements documented
- [ ] **UI/UX materials**: Screenshots, mockups, design references shared
- [ ] **User stories**: Clear understanding of user needs
- [ ] **Constraints identified**: Technical, business, or timeline limitations
- [ ] **Success criteria defined**: Clear definition of completion

## üîç Codebase Analysis  
- [ ] **Similar features identified**: Existing patterns and implementations found
- [ ] **Reusable components**: Available components and utilities documented
- [ ] **Code conventions**: Naming patterns and architecture styles understood
- [ ] **Integration points**: How feature connects with existing system

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Investigation
**For database-related features, complete @docs/database-design.md checklist:**
- [ ] **Phase 1: Schema Investigation** - Current schema and data patterns understood
- [ ] **Phase 2: Domain Analysis** - Similar features and business rules analyzed
- [ ] **Phase 3: External Dependencies** - Third-party data structures verified
- [ ] **Phase 4: Migration Strategy** - Safe deployment and rollback approach planned

## üîó External Dependencies
- [ ] **APIs validated**: Third-party service responses verified with real data
- [ ] **Package compatibility**: Library versions and capabilities confirmed
- [ ] **Integration testing**: External service behavior documented
- [ ] **Error handling**: Failure scenarios and fallbacks identified

## ‚ö° Technical Validation
- [ ] **Performance requirements**: Load, speed, and scalability needs defined
- [ ] **Security considerations**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- [ ] **Testing strategy**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end test approach
- [ ] **Deployment approach**: How feature will be released and monitored

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Investigation in progress
**Next Step**: Complete all checklist items, then run `/plan [feature-name]`
```

## Key Principles

- **Investigation First**: No planning without thorough investigation
- **Interactive Process**: Engage with user to gather all necessary information
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All technical aspects must be explored
- **Documentation Focus**: Record findings for future reference
- **Blocking Mechanism**: `/plan` command checks for completed pre-plan

## Integration with Planning

- `/plan [feature-name]` requires completed `[feature-name]-pre-plan.md`
- All checklist items must be marked `[x]` 
- Investigation findings inform detailed planning
- Pre-plan serves as foundation for implementation design
