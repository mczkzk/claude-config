# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Methodology**: Follow t-wada (和田卓人) practices

## Core Principles
- **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: Write failing test → Make it pass → Improve design
- **Test-First**: Always write tests before implementation
- **Minimal Implementation**: Write only enough code to pass current test
- **Triangulation**: Add test cases to force generalization when needed

## Key References
- t-wada's TDD approach emphasizes disciplined cycles and minimal code changes
- Focus on sustainable development through comprehensive test coverage

## Application Across Modes

### All Development Modes
- **TDD methodology** applies during implementation phases following plan documents
- **Test-first approach** is integrated into plan document structure and implementation workflow

## Integration with Commands

- **`/plan`**: Structure TDD cycles in implementation tasks
- **Natural language implementation**: Apply TDD methodology with Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- **Manual development**: Follow TDD principles for sustainable development
