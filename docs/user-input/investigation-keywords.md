# Investigation Guidelines

## When Asked to Investigate
When receiving investigation requests ("調べて", "探して", "見つけて"):

- **Research-focused approach**: Gather information systematically
- **Temporary code allowed**: Write code for investigation if helpful
- **Clean up afterwards**: Remove temporary investigation code
- **Document findings**: Provide clear summary of discoveries
- **No permanent changes**: Focus on understanding, not implementation
