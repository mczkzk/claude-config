# Database Design Guidelines

**Universal principles for database design and migration management across all projects and technologies.**

---

## üéØ Core Philosophy

### The Golden Rule
**"Investigate First, Implement Second"** - Never make database changes without understanding the existing schema, data relationships, and domain requirements.

---

## üìã Universal Pre-Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Schema Investigation
```bash
# Technology-agnostic commands (adapt to your DB)
# PostgreSQL: \d table_name
# MySQL: DESCRIBE table_name  
# SQLite: .schema table_name
# MongoDB: db.collection.findOne()

# Sample existing data to understand patterns
# PostgreSQL: SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 5;
# MongoDB: db.collection.find().limit(5);
```

**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] What is the purpose of each existing column?
- [ ] What data types and constraints are used?
- [ ] Are there existing relationships/foreign keys?
- [ ] What indexes exist and why?
- [ ] What is the current data volume and growth pattern?

### Phase 2: Domain Analysis
- [ ] **Similar Features**: How do existing similar features handle data?
- [ ] **Unique Requirements**: What makes this feature different?
- [ ] **Business Rules**: What constraints does the domain impose?
- [ ] **Future Extensibility**: What changes might be needed later?
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: How will this affect query performance?

### Phase 3: External Dependencies
- [ ] **Third-party APIs**: What data structures do they actually return?
- [ ] **External Packages**: What are the real runtime types vs documentation?
- [ ] **Integration Points**: How do external systems expect data to be formatted?
- [ ] **Version Compatibility**: Are there breaking changes in dependencies?

### Phase 4: Migration Strategy
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Will existing data/code still work?
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Can changes be safely reverted?
- [ ] **Data Migration**: How will existing data be transformed?
- [ ] **Downtime Requirements**: Can changes be applied online?
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: How will changes be verified in production?

## üö® Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. **Copy-Paste Pattern Blindness**
‚ùå **Wrong**: "Feature X uses this pattern, so Feature Y should too"
‚úÖ **Right**: "Feature Y has similar needs to Feature X, but with these key differences..."

### 2. **Assumption-Driven Design** 
‚ùå **Wrong**: "The API probably returns data in format X"
‚úÖ **Right**: "Let me log the actual API response to confirm the format"

### 3. **Single-Use Design**
‚ùå **Wrong**: Design for exactly the current use case
‚úÖ **Right**: Design for current needs + reasonable future extension

### 4. **Documentation Trust Without Verification**
‚ùå **Wrong**: "The docs say it returns a string, so it must be a string"
‚úÖ **Right**: "The docs say string, but let me verify with actual runtime data"

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology-Agnostic Best Practices

### Migration Management

#### Development Phase
```bash
# Create experimental migrations freely
# Test with real data
# Iterate quickly
# Document what works and what doesn't
```

#### Pre-Production Cleanup
```bash
# Remove experimental/temporary migrations
# Consolidate related changes into single migration
# Ensure migrations are idempotent
# Test migration + rollback sequence
```

#### Production Deployment
```bash
# Backup before migration
# Apply migrations during low-traffic windows
# Monitor for performance impacts
# Have rollback plan ready
```

### Schema Design Principles

#### 1. **Clarity Over Cleverness**
- Use descriptive names for tables and columns
- Prefer explicit relationships over implicit ones
- Document complex business rules in comments

#### 2. **Consistency Within Domain**
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use similar data types for similar concepts
- Maintain consistent relationship patterns

#### 3. **Data Integrity**
- Use appropriate constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)
- Implement foreign key relationships where applicable
- Consider domain-specific validation rules

#### 4. **Performance Considerations**
- Index frequently queried columns
- Consider query patterns when designing schema
- Balance normalization vs query performance
- Plan for data growth

## üîç Investigation Techniques

### 1. **Runtime Data Logging**
```javascript
// Language-agnostic approach
console.log('INVESTIGATION: Actual data structure', actualObject);
// Log in development, remove before production
```

### 2. **Database Exploration**
```sql
-- Find existing patterns
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'existing_similar_table';

-- Sample data for understanding
SELECT * FROM existing_table LIMIT 10;

-- Check relationships
SELECT * FROM information_schema.key_column_usage 
WHERE table_name = 'target_table';
```

### 3. **Prototype Validation**
```javascript
// Create minimal test to verify assumptions
async function investigateDataStructure() {
  const data = await externalAPI.getData();
  console.log('PROTOTYPE: External API structure', data);
  // Verify assumptions before building schema
}
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] New schema follows existing project conventions
- [ ] All migrations are reversible
- [ ] Performance requirements are met
- [ ] Data integrity is maintained
- [ ] External integrations work as expected

### Process Success
- [ ] Investigation was thorough and documented
- [ ] Assumptions were validated with real data
- [ ] Changes were implemented incrementally
- [ ] User feedback was incorporated early
- [ ] Rollback plan was tested

### Future-Proofing Success
- [ ] Schema can accommodate reasonable future requirements
- [ ] External dependency changes won't break the design
- [ ] Code is maintainable and well-documented
- [ ] Performance will scale with expected data growth

## üí° Quick Reference

### Before Every Database Change
1. **Understand** existing schema and data
2. **Investigate** external dependencies with real data
3. **Prototype** key assumptions
4. **Design** with future needs in mind
5. **Implement** incrementally
6. **Validate** with real usage
7. **Document** lessons learned

### Red Flags That Require Investigation
- "This should work like Feature X"
- "The API probably returns..."
- "We can change this later if needed"
- "It's just a simple table addition"
- "The migration is straightforward"

### Green Lights for Implementation
- ‚úÖ Existing schema is well understood
- ‚úÖ External data structures are verified
- ‚úÖ Domain requirements are clearly defined
- ‚úÖ Migration path is tested
- ‚úÖ Rollback strategy is confirmed

**Remember**: Time spent in investigation saves multiples of that time in fixing design mistakes later.
