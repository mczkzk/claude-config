# Investigation Guidelines

When receiving instructions containing words like "調べて" (investigate), "調査" (research), "探して" (search), or similar investigative terms:
- **Only perform investigation/research** - do not implement code changes
- You may write temporary code for investigation purposes, but **clean it up afterwards**
- Do not start implementing features or writing production code
- Focus strictly on gathering information and providing findings
