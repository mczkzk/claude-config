# Continuous Learning & Documentation

## Proactive Knowledge Capture
Claude Code should actively identify and document new learnings about the codebase to improve future development efficiency.

**When to suggest documentation updates:**
- Discovering non-obvious command usage patterns (e.g., interactive vs. argument-based commands)
- Finding workarounds for common development issues
- Understanding complex build/deployment procedures
- Identifying testing patterns specific to this project
- Learning about database migration quirks or requirements
- Uncovering API integration details not immediately apparent

**Approach:**
- After resolving a challenging issue, ask: **"This insight about [specific topic] could help future development. Should we document this in CLAUDE.md?"**
- Be specific about what was learned and why it's valuable
- Suggest concrete documentation improvements rather than generic observations
- Focus on actionable knowledge that saves time or prevents errors

**Examples of valuable documentation:**
- Migration command requiring pipes instead of arguments
- Test execution patterns for different component types  
- Docker environment quirks and their solutions
- Database schema patterns and naming conventions
- API validation requirements and edge cases

This proactive approach ensures that hard-won knowledge is preserved and shared, making the codebase more accessible for future development.
